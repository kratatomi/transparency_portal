            "Proposal text": "My proposal: 1BCH -> Celery I propose to swap all of the 1BCH tokens (approximately 145880.67 1BCH) in the portfolio balance for additional Celery to be staked on celery.cash. I am proposing swapping the 1BCH tokens since they can no longer be staked and I personally see no purpose for holding a DEX token that is not staked for some type of profit, especially since DEX tokens seem to trend predominantly downwards over time. I'm proposing to swap for Celery for that sweet, sweet, 100% APY. The 1BCH token should be swapped it their entirety in one transaction on Mistswap.fi. Happy voting!",
